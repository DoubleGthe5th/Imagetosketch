# Imagetosketch
Converts an image into a sort of 'sketch' (Outlines image)

Contains 3 code files

Imagechanger compresses the images by color (makes images have less color to ease the process of outlining image)

Outliner sketches an outline of the compressed image (Sets all pixels considered outline as white, the rest is transparent)

Videomaker takes a video and converts it into a jpeg sequence of outlined frames to be made into a single video
